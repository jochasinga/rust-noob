Learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) as your first language.

**note**: [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/) is also a great learning material.

## What
This is intended to be an over-simplified yet comprehensive guide to get anyone with zero programming skill (ok, to be realistic, with little ... like if you're learning Python or JavaScript and already got past functions, you're good to go).

Rust isn't for the faint of heart and the impatient, but so is C and C++. Moreover, the latters aren't also for humans. Seriously.

Rust is like a strict parent who will seem like inhibiting at first, but that's out of love and for your (program's) safety's sake. Also, Rust has one of the best advices when it comes to throwing errors and warnings, and thus can be very instructive as a first language.

## Why
I joined [Recurse Center Summer-2 batch](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), and I'm too excited to think of a focused project at this point. Learning Rust happens to be on my bucket list, and I thought why not just create a public guide so that anyone, even those new to programming, can learn this fabulous, [world's most loved programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)!

## When
Ideally, you should be able to finish this guide in under a week and start coding something cool in Rust. The repo is divided into 7 directories for 7 days, all which organize topics and relevant snippets one can normally digest in less than 3 hours each day for one week.

## Who
You!

## Setting up
If you haven't already, head to [Rust download page](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) to install Rust and Cargo, the awesome package manager. Or, just paste this on your terminal:

```bash

curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

```

For editor, anything would do. I'd recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with Rust extension, which is super simple, light and fast.

## Contributions
Very welcome! Take a peak at the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition) for inspiration and order of topics, and just make sure to work on a subsequent day directory (i.e. if `day2` is missing, create the directory and start working on a project that picks up from `day1`. if `day4` exists, but you think a topic should be there, just add it).

Use `cargo new --bin <project>` to create a topic project. Here's example:

```bash

$ cd day2
$ cargo new functions --bin

```
